# Predicting-Home-Prices

This data science project series is about building a real estate price prediction website for the Canton of Zurich. 
First, I built a model using sklearn and linear regression using Melbourne home prices dataset from kaggle.com. 
Second step was to write a python flask server that uses the saved model to serve http requests. 
Third component is the website built in html, css and javascript that allows user to enter home square ft area, 
bedrooms etc and it will call python flask server to retrieve the predicted price
